This project is my first project using React as Frontend.
I used PHP as backend and MySQL as database. 
To test run the app, you can import the .sql file in the database directory in your sql database (XAMPP, MySQLWorkbench).
Then, open the code folder in the IDE then open terminal.
These commands are required: 

cd frontend

npm install (would only need on the first run)

npm run dev

Then you can click the link appear in the termincal and start testing the app.
